## Short Description:
Enable the unmasking of cyber threats — AI augmentation meets the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.  AiTTRIBUTOR turns indicators into foresight and adversaries into open books.

## Long Description:
You are a cybersecurity professional sitting at your desk on a Friday afternoon, wrapping up your workday to enjoy your weekend. Just as the clock approaches 5PM, you get an alert for suspicious activity and you fear your fun-filled weekend will be consumed by incident response stand ups, intelligence collection to assess the potential fall out of the activity, and best attempts to identify the adversary to put a name to the folks who ruined our weekend.
 
Imagine having a digital Sherlock Holmes at your disposal, specifically trained in the dark arts of cyber warfare. That's what you get when NaiBLE's cutting-edge technology meets the MITRE ATT&CK framework — a formidable duo that transforms mere digital signals into a window to the adversary's mind.
 
By harnessing the analytical prowess of AI, fed with the intricate blueprints of cyber adversary tactics laid out by MITRE ATT&CK, your security team isn't just reacting; they're predicting. They're not just deflecting; they're decoding the DNA of the attack.
 
With this AI-infused oracle, every network anomaly, every suspicious log, is not just noise; it's a clue. A clue that crafts a narrative of the intruder, painting a vivid picture of their methods, motives and next move, before they even make it.
 
You're not chasing shadows anymore. You're anticipating strikes, understanding adversaries, and turning their stealth into your strategy. This is the new era of digital defense — proactive, predictive, and powered by the genius blend of GPT and MITRE ATT&CK. Guard your cyber frontiers by knowing the enemy better than they know themselves. Because in the game of cyberspace, the best defense is a smarter offense.

## Problem:
Incident responders, threat hunters, and intelligence analysts often spend a large portion of their time trying to attribute malicious activity on their networks to a specific threat actor. Knowing who the threat actor is assists analysts in understanding what future attack activity is likely, given historical intelligence reports detailing past actions. However, battling a threat actor in real time is a race against time and analysts do not have the opportunity to read everything. Further, with hundreds of threat actors and literally billions of possible unique TTP sets, conducting attribution on an actor is all but impossible. While IOCs are often directly linked to specific actors, behaviors are much more difficult to use towards attribution. 

## Solution:
Naible's AiTTRIBUTOR includes ingestion of both professionally curated IOC lists (in the public domain) and the entire MITRE ATT&CK framework and all of its associated intelligence.  AiTTRIBUTOR is a highly customized GPT that walks the user through the attribution process and can even task the user to hunt for specific activity that has been correlated by the engine to be the most likely next threat action. This significantly cuts the time an organization would normally take to remediate an attack.

## Market Scope:
Any organization that conducts incident response, threat hunting, and/or intelligence analysis will benefit from using Naible's AiTTRIBUTOR. Our agent will save time and create unparalleled efficiencies in cyber threat intelligence attribution.

## Revenue Streams:
1. Subscription fees - a subcription-based model where organizations pay monthly/quarterly/yearly to access an expert-curated attribution engine to significantly cut down the time it takes to remediate a cyber attack.
2. Custom licensing - a service-based approach to an expertly built, highly customized version of AiTTRIBUTOR
3. Custom training - a service-based custom training program that enables customers to use AiTTRIBUTOR at an expert level
